**Hello! I'm new to learning Python.**<br>
This is my first boilerplate for a combination of **Django + mySQL + nodeJS**

Accordingly, **Django** serves as a web server, this is a web server
**Mysql** is a database, and **nodeJS** compiles SCSS, TypeScript using Gulp, and also copies templates from the src folder to the project statics folder.
Gulp also enables synchronization of updates to static files and project templates using browsersync

Let’s not ramble on for too long, but **let’s get down to business**.<br>
Now I will indicate the sequential steps that you need to do to deploy this boilerplate

Here's what we need:
```
- python >= 3.12.1
- django >= 5.0.1
- mysqlclient >= 2.2.1
- python-dotenv >= 1.0.0
```

Download Python

After installing python:
`pip install django mysqlclient python-dotenv`
